# User Service

User Service is a RESTful API built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. It provides functionality for user authentication, account management, and basic CRUD operations on a user table in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.
2. **Database Integration**: Connects to a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve user information.
3. **Express Framework**: Built on the Express framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
4. **RESTful API**: Follows RESTful principles for designing APIs.

### Running the Project

Before running the project, make sure to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Local Server

```bash
npm run start
```

### Start the Database Server

Assuming the database is set up with the required schema and configuration:

```bash
pg_ctl -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@14 start
```

```bash
psql postgres # Launch the PostgreSQL shell
/conninfo # View connection details
```

### API Endpoints

- GET /users: Retrieve a list of all users.
- GET /users/:id: Retrieve details of a specific user (protected route, requires authentication).
- POST /users: Create a new user.
- PUT /users/:id: Update details of a specific user (protected route, requires authentication).
- DELETE /users/:id: Delete a specific user.

### Authentication Endpoints

- POST /auth/login: Login a user and return a JWT.
- POST /auth/signup: Create a new user

### Security Considerations

User authentication is implemented using JWT for secure and stateless communication.
Passwords are hashed before storing them in the database to enhance security.
